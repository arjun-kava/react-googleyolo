# React googleyolo

The goal of this component is to expose a React `Provider` component, as well as a `withGoogleyolo` connector-style method to fish `googleyolo` from the context and pass it down to a component.

[Googleyolo] is of course what google calls its smartlock / one-tap sign-up and sign-in library.
